		    Adrenaline: Attacking with bullets increases the bar. When bar is full, click Z to gain healing, faster movement and attack speed. <br>
		    Annihilation: Fill bar by losing/gaining hp. When bar is full, click X to unleash hellfire in all directions, and a powerful blast afterwards. <br>
		    (Work in Progress!) Boss: "The Blob" , spawns every two minutes. Has three attacks to throw at you, <br>
		    but they have a 20 second cooldown before they can use another. Every spawn will increase the hp and difficulty of the boss, good luck! <br>
		    When HP falls below 0, you enter Overtime (extra time before game ends), immediately gain all powerups. <br>
